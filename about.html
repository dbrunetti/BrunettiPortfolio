			<h3>The Basics</h3>
			<p>I'm from a small town in Connecticut where I lived until I went to College in Illinois. Since then, I've lived in Montana, Florida, and just recently moved to the Detroit area. My wife and I live in Warren with our very cute one-year-old son and our very jealous dog.</p>
			<h3>My Interests<h3>
			<ol>
				<li>Coding</li>
				<p>I've been teaching myself coding in my spare time over the last few months to get the sense of it and it's really fun! I really enjoy the challenge of running into new problems and figuring out how to fix them.</p>
				<li>Writing</li>
				<p>Before I started learning how to code, my go-to spare time activity was writing fiction. I'm unpublished, but storytelling is my passion. I'm excited for coding to be my day job so I can use my spare time for storytelling again!</p>
				<li>Travel</li>
				<p>I love to travel! Most recently, my wife and I travelled to Guam to visit her sister and brother-in-law and their new baby. My favorite place I've ever been is Israel.</p>
				<li>Soccer</li>
				<p>Speaking of interest in things overseas, I'm an avid soccer fan! My favorite team is <a href="http://www.tottenhamhotspur.com" id="spurs">Tottenham Hotspur</a> who play in the English Premier League. They had their best season in a long time last year, but weren't able to win the league. I'm pretty excited about the possibility of a Detroit-based MLS expansion team coming in the next few years. Not excited about the extra traffic, though...

			<p>My favorite quote is from <cite>Ender's Game</cite> by Orson Scott Card:</p>
